'''
    Given a string s, determine if it is a valid palindrome or not

    Example
    s = 'racecar'

    if we flip racecar, we get racecar, which is the same as our input
    this makes it a palindrome

    Example2
    s = 'abc'
    
    the flip of 'abc' is 'cba', which is not the same as the input
    this is NOT a palindrome

    Constraints (ok this doesn't matter)
    len(s) < 100,000
