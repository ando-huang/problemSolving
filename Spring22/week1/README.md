# Welcome to Week 1!

### Instructions

Fork this repo! (That way I don't have to give every individual permissions to
branch) Fork from the webpage in the top right corner, into your own github and
clone the repo copy from there to work on it. 

**If you aren't familiar with git, you can just download this week1 folder and
work within it**

Between you and your partner, pick one problem to do each.
Give yourself 30 minutes to work on the problem on BinarySearch.com
if you use a language other than Python save your work in a file with the same title but appropriate extension (.java/.c, etc)
When you and your partner have both done your problem, set aside some time to interview each other on the problems you did

### Interviewing

You can use Codeshare to see the same code at once.

Begin by presenting the problem statement and example. 
Let the interviewee talk through their proposed solution
If you see some holes in it, ask about the area (What happens if the input is x?)
When you are satisfied with the proposed solution, or 10 minutes have passed, write some code
Record the code, flip roles. 

### To run the programs
You can either run it in an IDE like VSCode, PyCharm, etc, or in terminal with
`python<version> <filename>`
