'''
    Given a binary tree (root), find the value of the deepest node. If there is more than one deepest node, then return the leftmost one.

    Restraints
    n <= 100,000 where n is the number of nodes in the tree

    Example

        0
       / \
      5   9
         / \
        1   3
       / \
      4   2

> 4

    Explanation
    The nodes 2 and 4 have the same depth in the tree, so 4 is returned because it is leftmost between the two nodes.

    Before diving into the code, it may be helpful to
    - consider the problem, what is needed to determine the solution?
    - draw up your own potential solution
