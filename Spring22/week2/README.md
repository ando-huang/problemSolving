### Instructions
The focus this week is on being able to interpret existing code
Some of the exercises just use unhelpful naming
Some of the exercises use completely incorrect naming

You can run the programs with an IDE or `$ python3 <filename>.py`

Determine what the functions do, change variable/function names
so that you can easily understand the purpose of the function

You can also add documentation, similar to JavaDoc

Refer to sample.py for a documented and (somewhat) well named example

I'll send pairings again, you can discuss your interpretations and naming
