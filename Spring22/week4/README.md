# Welcome to week 4!

The goal for this week is just to come up with a theoretical solution. 
Strongly encourage you to just write your code/pseudocode on paper.
Using actual testing on the problem site is discouraged, rather, try to do all your testing manually.
Problem solving sites like leetcode.com and binarysearch.com typically have a few example test cases that you can run through, so try to simulate your theoretical code going through that. 

### Tips for simulating runs
Pay attention to any iterables, like indices or elements. I like to write them down on the side, in commented parts of code if I'm writing in a text editor, or just on paper in columns

Try not to get caught up in what you want the code to do, execute your code as it's written. This can be difficult when you just have pseudocode on paper, so be sure you're familiar with how everything you use works.
